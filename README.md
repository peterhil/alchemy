# Alchemy

A game of alchemy where you advance on the Tree of Life.

You need to collect things from a hexagonal map that are related to
the ten sephiroth, and keep the tree in balance while doing so â€“
otherwise you might slip back levels.

The game is written in Fennel Lisp.

Includes some obscure complex mathematics and weird emanations of forms.

## Testing
